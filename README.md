# paintball
old paint ball script I made, think the flag object was the only issue I had but I might've fixed it I can't remember. was able to find this laying around somewhere in my old drive of the lua scripts I made, and thought to upload this one because it was my 2nd script I was proud of, so there isn't really any point in asking about the dependencies, can't be bothered, it's not anything good anyways.
